%    PROGRAM : VIBRATO 
%    
%    PRROGRAM TO TAKE IN AN INPUT AUDIO AND PERFORM A 
%    VIBRATO(PITCH FLUCTUATION) ON IT. THIS IS DONE BY IMPLEMENTING A 
%    MODULATING DELAY LINE USING AN LFO.
%    THIS USES THE DOPPLER EFFECT TO PRODUCE THE PITCH CHANGE BY 
%    CONSTANTLY CHANGING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE OBSERVER AND SOURCE.
